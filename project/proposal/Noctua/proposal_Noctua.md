  <h2>Key components</h2>
The following are the key components of a data science project proposal:

  <h3>1. Executive Summary</h3>
Restaurant reviews from Google are often used to survey places for customers that want to try that place out. We will perform an analysis on the reviews to determine whether it is positive or the opposite. From the analysis, we can conclude if a customer was satisfied with the service that was offered by the restaurant. Users who are searching for restaurants or places to eat will be able to find one not only by the ratings, but also with added criterias and information given or extracted from the review.

In today's fast-paced society, people are constantly on the go and looking for convenient places to grab a quick meal or drink. Cafes have become a popular choice for people who want to relax, work, or socialize while enjoying a cup of coffee or a tasty treat. However, with so many cafes to choose from, it can be challenging for customers to find the right one that meets their needs and expectations.

Other problem include rating systems that usually do not tell the whole story, sentiment and feeling of reviewer towards the cafe. With this system, we will extract more information to users through text analysis algorithms.

As a result, `customer satisfaction` has become a crucial factor in the success of cafes. In this project, we aim to monitor the Google reviews about customer satisfaction on cafes in Johor using NLP. NLP is a subfield of `artificial intelligence` that deals with the interaction between computers and human language.

However, existing rating systems that usually do not tell the whole story, sentiment and feeling of reviewer towards the cafe. With this system, we will extract more information to users through text analysis algorithms.

By analyzing the text data from Google reviews, we can `identify the common themes and sentiments` expressed by customers, such as the quality of food and beverages, the level of service, the ambiance, and the value for money. We can also `extract insights` on specific aspects of customer satisfaction, such as the frequency of positive and negative reviews, the average rating, and the most common keywords used.

Overall, this project aims to provide insights into the customer satisfaction of cafes in Johor and help cafe owners and managers make data-driven decisions to `improve their services and offerings`.


<h3>3. Goals and Objectives</h3>

Problem Statement:
Customer reviews do not always show the true meaning. It can make other customers misunderstand the views of those customers who might want to try the cafe. Newer customers might find some reviews unreliable after trying out themselves. There are also some people who wanted to downgrade the cafe by intentionally giving negative reviews. The cafe owner also might want to improve their services thus, a reliable review might help them. 

The significance of this project lies in its potential to provide valuable insights into the customer satisfaction of cafes in Johor. Cafe owners and managers can use these insights to improve their services and offerings, such as by addressing specific complaints or negative feedback, enhancing the quality of their products, and improving the overall customer experience.

- To determine whether the reviews were positive or negative. 
- To determine the most ordered and recommended meal from each cafe.
- To analyze the percentage used word based on the reviews. 
- To train a model that can successfully identify a positive or negative review
- To ensure the review made by users is reliable based on our modelâ€™s outcome 

In this project, we aim to monitor the Google reviews about customer satisfaction on cafes in Johor using Natural Language Processing (NLP). .

### 4. Scope: 
The aim of this project is to monitor Google reviews of cafes in Johor Bharu, Malaysia to gain insights into customer satisfaction levels and identify common themes in customer feedback. To achieve this, we will collect data from Google My Business, which will provide access to a large volume of reviews for cafes in the Johor Bharu area. To achieve the result in question, here are the project scope statement that we will be using to our aid.

- 1. `Data Sources` Collect Google reviews of cafes in Johor Bharu, Malaysia using the `Enter data source here`
- 2. `Tools and Technologies` Use web scraping tools like BeautifulSoup or Scrapy to scrape the reviews from `Enter data source here`, and then utilize Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to perform sentiment analysis on the reviews
- 3. `Research Objectives` The objective of the research is to monitor customer satisfaction in cafes in Johor Bharu, Malaysia through analyzing the sentiment of the Google reviews, identifying the most commonly mentioned aspects of customers' experiences, and measuring overall customer satisfaction levels for each cafe.
- 4. `Sampling` Collect reviews of cafes that are located in Johor Bharu, Malaysia, and only include reviews that have been posted within the last `Enter duration here`.
- 5. `Data Cleaning and Preparation` Clean the data by removing any irrelevant or duplicate reviews, correcting any spelling or grammar errors, and standardizing the format of the data.
- 6. `Analysis methods` Analyze the data using descriptive statistics, topic modeling, and sentiment analysis to identify common themes and patterns in customer feedback and to measure overall customer satisfaction levels.
- 7. `Reporting` Present the findings of the analysis in a report that includes charts and graphs to visualize the data, as well as a written summary of the key findings and recommendations for improving customer satisfaction in the cafes in Johor Bharu, Malaysia.
- 8. **If the format is wrong, change it at will**
